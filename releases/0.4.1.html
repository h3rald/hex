<h4>Fixes</h4>
<ul>
    <li>Addressed segmentation fault when interpreting bytecode on Windows (filename was not populated for symbol
        position).</li>
    <li>Ensured that newlines are correctly processed on Windows.</li>
    <li>Renamed the <code>operator</code> property in <code>hex_item_t</code> to <code>is_operator</code> to avoid
        conflicts in C++ code (operator is a reserved keyword).</li>
</ul>
